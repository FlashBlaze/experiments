# Experiments

This repo will contain code to satisfy my shiny object syndrome and like most of the repos, this too will probably be abandoned.

### PS

youtube-resources submodule is private (for now) which contains some tidal code and will contain some form of code related files. Rest of the files will be available on Gumroad or some other platform.

The reason for hosting rest of the files elsewhere is, GitHub has a 100mb upload limit for files and also, I do not want to share YouTube resources using a coding platform.
